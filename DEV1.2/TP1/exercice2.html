        <p>Emoticons</p>
        <p>Emoticons are textual portrayals of a writer's moods or facial
            <br>expressions in the form of icons. Originally, these icons
            <br>consisted of ASCII art.
        </p>
        <p>Emoticons can generally be divided into two groups: Western (mainly
            <br>from America and Europe) or horizontal; Eastern or vertical (mainly
            <br>from east Asia).
        </p>

        <p>
            Western style emoticons are mostly written from left to right as
            <br>though the head is rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees.

            Eastern emoticons generally are not rotated sideways. They first
            <br>arose in Japan, where they are referred to as kaomoji.
